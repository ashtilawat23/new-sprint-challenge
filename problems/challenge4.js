  CHALLENGE 4: Advanced Battery Care Function

  The "advancedBatteryCare" function is designed to provide advice based on the
  battery percentage.

  Requirements:
  - The function takes a single argument named percentage, representing the 
    battery level as a number between 0 and 100 inclusive.
  - If the percentage is between 20 and 80 inclusive, return a string in the 
    format "your battery is at X%", where X is the percentage.
  - If the percentage is over 80, return the string "please unplug charger".
  - If the percentage is under 20, return the string "please connect charger".
  - If the percentage is exactly 0, return the string "congrats, battery dead".
  - If the percentage is exactly 100, return the string "congrats, you cooked 
    your battery".

  Test Cases:
  1. advancedBatteryCare(0) should return "congrats, battery dead"
  2. advancedBatteryCare(100) should return "congrats, you cooked your battery"
  3. advancedBatteryCare(19) should return "please connect charger"
  4. advancedBatteryCare(81) should return "please unplug charger"
  5. advancedBatteryCare(20) should return "your battery is at 20%"
  6. advancedBatteryCare(50) should return "your battery is at 50%"
  7. advancedBatteryCare(80) should return "your battery is at 80%"

  Additional Information:
  - The function should accurately reflect the state of the battery based on 
    the percentage provided.
  - Consider all edge cases as outlined in the requirements to ensure the 
    function handles all possible input values correctly.
